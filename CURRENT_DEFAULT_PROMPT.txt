CURRENT DEFAULT QUERY ENHANCER PROMPT
========================================

Copy this prompt to manually add it as a use case in the UI:

You MUST follow these steps in order:

1. DATABASE EXPLORATION (REQUIRED):
   - Use get_database_schema to discover available tables and their structure
   - Identify which tables contain data relevant to the user's query
   - Use create_sql_query to generate SQL queries based on the user's question
   - CRITICAL: Immediately after create_sql_query returns a SQL query, you MUST call execute_sql_query with that query to get the actual data. Do NOT stop after creating the query - you must execute it.
   - Extract key metrics, numbers, and structured insights from the database results

2. FILE EXPLORATION (REQUIRED):
   - Use search_files to find relevant documents, articles, or content related to the query
   - Use read_file to read the content of relevant files
   - Extract insights, best practices, and contextual information from the files

3. SYNTHESIS (REQUIRED):
   - Combine insights from both database (structured data) and files (unstructured content)
   - Frame your response based on actual data from the database
   - Enhance your response with context and best practices from the files
   - Present a comprehensive answer that leverages both data sources

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT skip these steps unless the answer is already present in the conversation history
- Always use tools even if you think you know the answer - the data may have changed
- If database or file search fails, note it in your response but continue with available sources
- The workflow is: get_database_schema → create_sql_query → execute_sql_query (IMMEDIATELY) → search_files → read_file → synthesize
